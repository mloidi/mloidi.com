          This Cookie Policy explains how cookies and similar technologies
          (collectively, “Cookie(s)”) are used when you visit our Site. A “Site”
          includes our websites, emails, and other applications owned and
          operated by mloidi.com (the “Company”, “our”, or “us”) as well as any
          other services that display this Cookie Policy. This policy explains
          what these technologies are and why they are used, as well as your
          right to control their use.

        <div className="my-1">
          A cookie is a small text file (often including a unique identifier),
          that is sent to a user’s browser from a website's computers and stored
          on a user’s computer's hard drive or on a tablet or mobile device
          (collectively, “Computer”). A Cookie stores a small amount of data on
          your Computer about your visit to the Site.
        </div>
        <div className="my-1">
          We may also use “web beacons” (also known as “clear GIFs” or “pixel
          tags”) or similar technologies on our Site to enable us to know
          whether you have visited a web page or received a message. A web
          beacon is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be
          a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an email or
          other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote website on the
          internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or
          receipt of a web page or message. A web beacon helps us to understand
          whether you came to our website from an online advertisement displayed
          on a third-party website, measure successes of email marketing
          campaigns and improve our website performance. They may also enable us
          to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other
          information about you, including your personal information. In many
          instances, web beacons rely on cookies to function properly, and so
          declining cookies will impair their functioning.

          We place and access Cookies on your Computer; these Cookies are known
          as “first-party Cookies.” Cookies may also be placed and accessed by
          some of our third-party vendors, which are known as “third-party
          Cookies” and are described below. Some Cookies are "session Cookies,"
          which means that they are temporary Cookies that are only stored on
          your device while you are visiting our Site. Other Cookies are
          "persistent Cookies," which means that they are stored on your device
          for a period of time after you leave our Site.

          function disabled, as set by default by certain browsers), your

        <div className="my-1">
          Below we list the different types of Cookies that are used on the Site
          that you are visiting.
        </div>
        <div className="my-1">
          To the extent any personal information is collected through
          first-party Cookies, our Privacy Policy applies and complements this
          Cookie Policy. Personal information collected through a third-party
          Cookie is subject to the privacy policy of that third party, and not
          our Privacy Policy.

        <div className="my-1">
          Analytics Cookies collect information about your use of the Site, and
          enable us to improve the way it works. For example, Analytics Cookies
          show us which are the most frequently visited pages on the Site, help
          us record any difficulties you have with the Site, and show us whether
          our advertising is effective or not. Analytics Cookies allow us to see
          the overall patterns of usage on the Site, rather than the usage of a
          single person. We use information from Analytics Cookies to analyze
          the Site traffic, but we do not examine this information for
          individually identifying information.
