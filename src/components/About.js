        I am a web developer currently located in Pamplona Spain. You know, the
        running of the bulls. When Iâ€™m not running with them, my main focus is
        to developing new web technologies. In my free time, I am constantly
        experimenting with new projects, pushing my skills to adapt the latest
        web tech to build new web designs.
      </AboutParagraph>
      <AboutParagraph color={selectedColor}>
        I am passionate about development and design. On the frontend, I work
        mainly with React while on the backend I work with Node and Express. As
        for a data base I prefer to use MongoDB.

      <AboutParagraph color={selectedColor}>
        As a growing community, the web industry is one that I have learned so
        much from and hope to give back just as much. I am mostly excited about
        the future of this industry. There is so much we have yet to discover,
        and I cannot wait to see what is coming next.
